# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Camera` component where the image preview fails to render correctly when custom styling is applied to its container.  The preview may appear distorted or entirely blank, particularly when using flexbox or more complex layouts.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when applying styles to the view containing the Expo Camera component.  The image preview within the camera seems to be incompatible with certain styling configurations, resulting in a broken or missing preview.

## Solution
The solution involves adjusting the styling approach. Instead of directly styling the container of the `Camera` component, consider using specific props within the `Camera` component itself for styling options like `style` or `cameraStyle`.  Alternatively, ensure your styling does not conflict with the internal layout mechanisms of the `Camera` component. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the broken camera preview in the `bug.js` example.
5. Compare with the corrected preview in `bugSolution.js`.
